		**0x0C. Python - Almost a Circle**

This project is part of the Higher Level Curriculum at ALX School and focuses on
reviewing various concepts in Python, including Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
, file I/O, serialization, unit testing, and more. The project involves creating
a base class named "Base" that will serve as the foundation for other classes,
such as "Rectangle" and "Square."

##Requirements
	Python Scripts:
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
Interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5
All files should end with a new line
The first line of all files should be #!/usr/bin/python3
A README.md file at the root of the folder is mandatory
Code should use Pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
All files must be executable
The length of files will be tested using wc
All modules, classes, and functions should be documented

Python Unit Tests:
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All test files should end with a new line
All test files should be inside a folder named tests
The unittest module should be used
All test files should be Python files with the extension .py
Test files and folders should start with test_
All tests should be executed using the command: python3 -m unittest discover tests

Tasks:
A series of tasks need to be completed, ranging from creating a base class to
implementing specific functionalities in derived classes.
Tasks include unit testing, validation, and documentation.

#How to Run Tests
To run the tests, execute the following command:
python3 -m unittest discover tests

#Learning Objectives
Upon completing this project, you should be able to:

Understand and implement Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python
Work with inheritance, exceptions, and file I/O
Write and execute unit tests using the unittest module
Handle serialization and deserialization of objects using JSON

#Copyright and Plagiarism
You are responsible for creating solutions for the tasks on your own.
Plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.
